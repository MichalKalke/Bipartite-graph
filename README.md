# Bipartite graph

One of my first C++ projects which is checking if given graph is bipartite or not.

### Input file
Input file is a simple .txt with vertices of the graph.

### Switches
The program can be open with below switches:
- `-i` input file 
- `-o` output file
- `-h` helper 

### Output file
It is also .txt file. If the graph is bipartite the output file will have the information that it is bipartite and will have vertixes grouped in to two groups.

If it's not, the information will be: it is not a bipartite graph and will have given at the begging vertixes.
